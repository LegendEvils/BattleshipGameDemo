Phaser Demo Game - «Battleship»
====================================================

Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle) is a guessing game for two players. It is known worldwide as a pencil and paper game which dates from World War I. Before the game begins, each player secretly arranges his/her ships in the primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares in the grid. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap.

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a "miss" the player marks his/her primary grid with a white peg; if a "hit" they mark it in their own primary grid with a red peg. The attacking player notes the hit or miss in his/her own "tracking" grid with an appropriate color peg (red for "hit", white for "miss"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet. After the player gets a hit he/she continues shooting until the player gets a miss. 

HTML5 game «Battleship» was created with popular JS framework Phaser.io. It's a demo game with a goal to show the  ability of creation of multiplayer games on Phaser. The application can be run on mobile touch devices Apple (iPad, iPhone), as well as on PC and MAC.
